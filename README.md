# customer_behavior_analysis
Data analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis using Python, SQL, and PowerBI

📌 Overview

This project showcases a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow using a real customer shopping behavior dataset in .csv format.
The goal is to understand customer patterns, clean and analyze the data, validate insights using SQL (PostgreSQL), and convert findings into an interactive Power BI dashboard and a structured Gamma presentation.

**This project demonstrates:**
- Analytical thinking
- Data cleaning & EDA capabilities
- SQL proficiency
- Business intelligence dashboarding
- Reporting & storytelling skills
